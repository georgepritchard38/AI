## Linear Regression (with gradient descent)

This project involves predicting the number of days of ice coverage on lake Mendota based on historic data, using linear regression. Linear regression is performed first in the closed form solution (as the features matrix is invertible) and then again using gradient descent in "regression.py". The model predicts the first year that there will be zero days of ice coverage on lake Mendota, and produces a plot of the mean squared error (MSE) loss over each iteration of gradient descent("loss_plot.jpg"). The plot "data_plot.jpg" visualizes the original historic ice coverage data in matplotlib.
