This repository Showcases Artificial Intelligence techniques and projects that I have developed throughout my academic career.

These projects were completed as part of CS 540 at University of Wisconsin - Madison,
taught by Professor Blerina Gkotse, Fall 2025. The README file for each project outlines the materials provided for the project, as well as my own contributions.
